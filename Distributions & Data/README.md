We started by using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to measure the difference between two probability distributions over a variable x. The two distribution used were the pixel value distributions obtained from each dataset. This allowed us to identify the 20\% of images from the UTKFace and FairFace dataset that represent the biggest outliers when compared to the distribution of the UTKFace dataset. These images were then compiled into separate folders to be used in Outlier Exposure testing and we analyzed the distribution of each dataset based on the frequency of the pixel values. The histograms for each dataset are shown below where blue represents the UTKFace dataset and orange represents the FairFace dataset. The x axis (pixels) are capped at 255 due to the typical RGB scale.
