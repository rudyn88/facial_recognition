Based on this perspective, we base the foundation of our work on the following observations from prior
works. The probability/confidence of the prevalent class of an input is proportional to
its norm. While the norm of a feature strongly scales the predictive probability, due to itâ€™s
unregularized nature the norm is not sensitive to the hardness of the input. In other words, the
norm could be the reason for bad sensitivity of the confidence to input distribution shift. Consequently,
the insensitive norm can be causally related to bad calibration. We will examine a strong correlation
between the quality of calibration and the magnitude of norm in this section. These folders show work on calculating the image norms
